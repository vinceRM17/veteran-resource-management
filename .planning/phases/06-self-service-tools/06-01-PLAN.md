<objective>
Create the content data layer and exercise browsing UI for Phase 6 self-service tools.

Purpose: Veterans need immediate access to evidence-based mental health exercises and transition planning resources. This plan creates all static content data files and the exercise browsing experience (landing page, topic listing, and individual topic detail pages).

Output: Two content data files (mental health exercises, transition checklists), a /tools landing page, a /tools/exercises topic browse page, and dynamic /tools/exercises/[topic] detail pages showing exercises with expandable step-by-step instructions.

  <name>Task 1: Create mental health exercise and transition checklist content data files</name>
  <files>src/content/mental-health-exercises.ts, src/content/transition-checklists.ts</files>
  <action>
Create two TypeScript content data files following the established pattern in src/content/documentation-checklists.ts (exported typed arrays with interfaces).

**File 1: src/content/mental-health-exercises.ts**

Define interfaces:
```typescript
export interface Exercise {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string; // 1-2 sentence plain-language summary
  duration: string; // e.g., "5-10 minutes"
  steps: string[]; // numbered step-by-step instructions
  source: string; // e.g., "Adapted from VA PTSD Coach"
  tip: string; // practical tip for the exercise
}

export interface ExerciseTopic {
  slug: string; // URL-safe slug: "ptsd", "anxiety", "sleep", "anger"
  name: string;
  description: string; // topic overview in plain language
  icon: string; // lucide icon name for reference
  exercises: Exercise[];
}
```

Create 4 topics with 3-4 exercises each (16 total). ALL content MUST read at 6th-8th grade reading level: short sentences (under 20 words), common words, active voice, no jargon. Source content from publicly available VA PTSD Coach app techniques and DoD Transition Assistance Program (TAP) resources.

Topics and exercises:

1. **PTSD Management** (slug: "ptsd")
   - Grounding exercise (5-4-3-2-1 senses technique)
   - Deep breathing (box breathing / 4-7-8 pattern)
   - Progressive muscle relaxation
   - Safe place visualization

2. **Anxiety Relief** (slug: "anxiety")
   - Belly breathing (diaphragmatic breathing)
   - Body scan relaxation
   - Thought challenging (writing down worries, testing if they are facts)
   - Mindful walking

3. **Sleep Improvement** (slug: "sleep")
   - Sleep hygiene checklist (consistent bedtime, no screens, cool room)
   - Wind-down routine (progressive relaxation before bed)
   - Stimulus control (bed only for sleep, get up if awake 20 min)
   - Worry journal (write worries before bed to clear your mind)

4. **Anger Management** (slug: "anger")
   - Timeout technique (step away, cool down, return)
   - Deep breathing for anger (slow exhale focus)
   - Physical activity release (walk, push-ups, stretch)
   - Assertive communication (use "I feel" statements instead of blame)

Each exercise step should be a clear, actionable sentence. Example step: "Close your eyes or look at a spot on the floor." NOT "Utilize visual focus reduction techniques."

**File 2: src/content/transition-checklists.ts**

Define interfaces:
```typescript
export interface ChecklistItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string; // plain-language explanation of what to do
  resources: { label: string; url: string }[]; // helpful links
}

export interface TransitionMilestone {
  slug: string; // "180-days", "90-days", "30-days"
  name: string; // "180 Days Before Separation"
  timeframe: string; // "6 months out"
  description: string;
  items: ChecklistItem[];
}
```

Create 3 milestones sourced from DoD TAP (Transition Assistance Program) and VA transition resources:

1. **180 Days Before Separation** (slug: "180-days", 6-8 items)
   - Attend TAP workshop
   - Request DD-214 review
   - Start VA healthcare enrollment (VA Form 10-10EZ)
   - File disability claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) if applicable
   - Start resume/LinkedIn profile
   - Research GI Bill education benefits
   - Get copies of service medical records
   - Set up a personal email (not .mil)

2. **90 Days Before Separation** (slug: "90-days", 6-8 items)
   - Apply for VA healthcare if not done
   - Register on VA.gov and set up eBenefits/ID.me
   - File for state benefits (unemployment, Medicaid if needed)
   - Open civilian bank account
   - Start job applications or school enrollment
   - Schedule final medical exams
   - Notify housing office and plan move
   - Research veteran service organizations in your area

3. **30 Days Before Separation** (slug: "30-days", 5-7 items)
   - Verify DD-214 is correct
   - Get final copies of all medical records
   - Set up mail forwarding
   - Cancel/transfer SGLI to VGLI life insurance
   - Confirm VA healthcare enrollment status
   - Register to vote at new address
   - Connect with local VSO for ongoing support

All content at 6th-8th grade reading level: short sentences, common words, no military jargon without explanation.
  </action>
  <verify>
Both files compile without TypeScript errors:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit src/content/mental-health-exercises.ts src/content/transition-checklists.ts
```
Mental health file exports at least 4 topics with 3+ exercises each. Transition file exports 3 milestones with 5+ items each.
  </verify>
  <done>
16+ mental health exercises across 4 topics and 3 transition milestones with 17+ checklist items exist as typed, importable TypeScript content files. All content written at 6th-8th grade reading level with evidence-based sourcing.
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Create self-service tools landing page and exercise browse/detail pages</name>
  <files>src/app/tools/page.tsx, src/app/tools/exercises/page.tsx, src/app/tools/exercises/[topic]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create 3 Next.js Server Component pages following established patterns from src/app/resources/documents/page.tsx (static content pages with Tailwind styling, shadcn/ui components, proper metadata).

**File 1: src/app/tools/page.tsx** (Self-Service Tools Landing)

Server Component with:
- Metadata: title "Self-Service Tools | Veteran Resource Management", description about exercises and guides
- Page heading "Self-Service Tools" with intro paragraph explaining that these are evidence-based resources
- Two feature cards in a 2-column grid (md:grid-cols-2):
  1. "Mental Health Exercises" card with brief description, links to /tools/exercises (use Card, CardHeader, CardContent from shadcn/ui)
  2. "Transition Planning Checklists" card with brief description, links to /tools/transition (will be built in Plan 02)
- Use lucide-react icons: Brain for exercises, ClipboardList for checklists
- Bottom note: "These tools are not a substitute for professional care. If you are in crisis, please use the resources at the top of this page." (crisis banner is already on every page)

**File 2: src/app/tools/exercises/page.tsx** (Exercise Topic Browse)

Server Component with:
- Metadata: title "Mental Health Exercises | Veteran Resource Management"
- Import mentalHealthExercises (the topics array) from content file
- Page heading "Mental Health Exercises" with intro paragraph about evidence-based techniques
- Grid of topic cards (sm:grid-cols-2 gap-6) — one Card per ExerciseTopic
- Each card shows: topic name, description, exercise count badge (e.g., "4 exercises"), and a Link to /tools/exercises/{topic.slug}
- Use Badge for exercise count, Card/CardHeader/CardContent for layout
- Map icons by topic slug to lucide-react icons: Shield for ptsd, Heart for anxiety, Moon for sleep, Flame for anger
- Back link to /tools at top

**File 3: src/app/tools/exercises/[topic]/page.tsx** (Exercise Detail by Topic)

Server Component with dynamic route:
- Import mentalHealthExercises from content file
- Find topic by slug from params, return notFound() if not found
- generateStaticParams() exporting all topic slugs for static generation
- generateMetadata() returning topic-specific title and description
- Page heading with topic name, description, and source attribution
- Each exercise rendered in an Accordion (from shadcn/ui) — one AccordionItem per exercise:
  - AccordionTrigger: exercise title + duration badge
  - AccordionContent: description, numbered steps list (ol with list-decimal), source attribution, tip in a highlighted box (bg-blue-50 border rounded p-4)
- Back link to /tools/exercises at top
- Bottom crisis note: "If any of these exercises bring up difficult feelings, reach out to the Veterans Crisis Line: 988 (press 1)."

Use the same layout patterns as the existing documentation checklists page: container mx-auto px-4 py-8 max-w-4xl, consistent heading hierarchy, accessible markup with semantic HTML.
