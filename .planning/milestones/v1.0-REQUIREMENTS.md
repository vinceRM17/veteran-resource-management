# Requirements: Veteran Resource Management

**Defined:** 2026-02-15
**Core Value:** A veteran in crisis or need can put in their information and immediately feel connected — to programs they qualify for, to people who can help, and to peers who understand what they're going through.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Foundation

### Crisis Intervention

- [ ] **CRISIS-03**: When crisis is detected, a full-page CrisisIntercept component renders with immediate access to help
- [ ] **CRISIS-04**: All crisis detection events are logged with audit trail for review

### Screening

- [ ] **SCREEN-01**: User can complete a multi-step screening questionnaire (5-7 questions for quick results)
- [ ] **SCREEN-02**: User selects role ("I am a veteran" vs "I am supporting a veteran") and flow adapts accordingly
- [ ] **SCREEN-03**: Screening questions use conditional logic (show/hide based on previous answers)
- [ ] **SCREEN-04**: User can complete screening without creating an account (guest mode)
- [ ] **SCREEN-05**: Screening results display matched programs with confidence scoring ("Likely Eligible" vs "Possibly Eligible")
- [ ] **SCREEN-06**: User can export screening results as printable PDF with matched programs and next steps

### Eligibility Engine

- [ ] **ELIG-01**: Eligibility rules are stored as JSON in database (not hardcoded in application code)

- [ ] **ELIG-03**: Each match includes confidence score, required documentation, and next steps
- [ ] **ELIG-04**: State/jurisdiction is a first-class entity — adding a new state requires configuration, not code changes
- [ ] **ELIG-05**: Rules cover 10-15 core veteran benefit programs (VA disability, healthcare, education, housing, employment)

### Resource Directory

- [ ] **DIR-01**: User can search across 85K+ veteran organizations with full-text search

- [ ] **DATA-02**: ETL pipeline imports business data from veteran-business-db (5,500+ records)
- [ ] **DATA-03**: Data validation rejects records that fail schema validation before import
- [ ] **DATA-04**: Database schema includes freshness tracking (last_verified_date, verification_method, confidence_score)

- **ADV-03**: B2B analytics dashboard for veteran service organizations

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Application submission to agencies | Each agency has own systems/auth; maintaining 50+ integrations has high failure rate |
| Real-time benefits dollar calculation | Rules too complex (dependents, bilateral factors, state variations); high error rate damages trust |
| AI chatbot for benefits questions | AI hallucinates on complex rules; users want human expertise for high-stakes decisions |
| Forum / community platform | Massive moderation burden, liability for crisis situations and misinformation |
| VA system integration (VBMS) | Requires accreditation; complex legal requirements |
| Native mobile app | Web-first; responsive design covers mobile use; defer until validated |
| Veteran identity verification | Creates barriers for caregivers; non-veterans have no incentive to misuse |
| Comprehensive claims tracking | VA.gov does this well; link to it, don't duplicate |
