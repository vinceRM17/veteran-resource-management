# Project State: Veteran Resource Management

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-16
**Current Phase:** 01-foundation-crisis-safety
**Current Plan:** 01 (Plan 1 of 4 complete)
**Status:** Executing Phase 1

## Project Reference

**Core Value:**
A veteran in crisis or need can put in their information and immediately feel connected — to programs they qualify for, to people who can help, and to peers who understand what they're going through. Isolation is the enemy; connection is the mission.

**Current Focus:**
Phase 1 - Foundation + Crisis Safety

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2026-02-15 | 7-phase roadmap structure derived from requirements | Requirements naturally cluster into foundation (1), data (2), core value (3-4), engagement (5-6), advanced (7) | Phases deliver incrementally verifiable capabilities |
| 2026-02-15 | Crisis resources in Phase 1, smart detection in Phase 4 | Always-visible crisis banner is safety requirement; smart detection requires screening flow to monitor | Non-negotiable safety baseline, then enhanced detection |
| 2026-02-15 | Directory before screening | Screening results link to directory; need populated data for end-to-end testing | Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3 |
| 2026-02-15 | Accounts deferred to Phase 5 | Guest mode screening is core value; accounts are retention feature | No forced account creation at launch |
| 2026-02-16 | Tailwind CSS 4 requires @tailwindcss/postcss plugin | Tailwind v4 separated PostCSS plugin from core package | Updated PostCSS config and CSS syntax (@import instead of @tailwind) |
| 2026-02-16 | CrisisBanner uses <aside> instead of div with role="banner" | Biome linter enforces semantic HTML over ARIA roles on generic elements | Improved accessibility with proper semantic elements |
| 2026-02-16 | System fonts only (no external font loading) | Minimize initial bundle size and improve Core Web Vitals | Faster page loads, better performance baseline |

### Active TODOs

None yet (awaiting phase planning).

### Known Blockers

None yet (awaiting phase planning).

### Research Flags

From research/SUMMARY.md, these phases need deeper research during planning:

- **Phase 2:** ETL pipeline for 85K+ records (batch processing, validation, error handling)
- **Phase 3:** Kentucky benefits programs (eligibility rules, income thresholds, documentation requirements)
- **Phase 4:** Crisis detection patterns (clinical validation, false positive/negative rates, partnership with 988/VA)
- **Phase 7:** Kentucky benefits interaction rules (SNAP + Medicaid, SSI + SSDI conflicts)

Phases 1, 5, 6 use standard patterns (skip research-phase).

## Session Continuity

**What we're building:**
Veteran resource platform connecting veterans/caregivers to 90K+ organizations, with benefits screening questionnaire that matches users to programs they qualify for.

**Where we are:**
Phase 1 in progress. Plan 01 complete: Next.js 16 foundation established with accessible layout shell and crisis resource banner on every page. 1 of 4 Phase 1 plans complete.

**What's next:**
Execute Plan 02 of Phase 1 (Testing Infrastructure & Accessibility Verification).

**Critical context:**
- Crisis safety is non-negotiable (always-visible resources in Phase 1, smart detection in Phase 4)
- Data quality is success/failure point (verification systems BEFORE import in Phase 2)
- Screening is core value (Phase 3 is most complex, benefits from Phases 1-2 complete)
- Research identified 4 pitfalls to avoid: data quality death spiral, crisis detection theater, false promise overmatching, black hole referral
